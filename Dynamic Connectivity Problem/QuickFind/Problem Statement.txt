Statement: Implement a class QuickUnion that can initialize an array of length N by assigning each index its own value. Then implement two methods as follows: 

            Initialization:
                Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
                Value: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

    1. connected: This will take two integer inputs p and q as index and check whether they have
    the same id/value and return a boolean output -
                    Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
                   Values: 0 2 2 3 2 5 6

            connected(1,4) -> True 
            connected(1,6) -> False

    2. union: This will take two integer inputs p and q as index and change id/value of all
    indices that has the id/value of p to the id/value of q - 

                    Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
                    Value: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
            
            union(1,2) -> 
                    Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
                    Value: 0 2 2 3 4 5 6
            
            union(1,4) ->
                    Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
                    Value: 0 4 4 3 4 6 6    (*Note that both the value of index 1 and 2 change)
