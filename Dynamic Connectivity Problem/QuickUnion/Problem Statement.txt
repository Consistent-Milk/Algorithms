Statement: Implement a class QuickUnion that can initialize an array of length N by assigning each index its own value. Then implement three methods as follows: 

    1. root: This method should be able find the 'root' of the element given as its argument -
                        Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
                       Values: 2 1 3 5 4 5 6
            Here, root(0) should create a flow like 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 5
            Thus it should give an output of root(0) = 5 

    2. connected: This method should implement the root() method and take in two elements as inputs and check whether those two elements have the same root and return a boolean value. 
                        Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
                       Values: 2 1 3 5 4 5 6
            Here, connected(0, 2) should return true.
                  connected(0, 4) should return false.

    3. union: This method should be able take two elements and change the initialized array by making the second element the root of the first element.
                        Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
                       Values: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6        (Initial Array of Elements)
                After using the method union (1,2) the array should change to:
                        Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
                       Values: 0 2 2 3 4 5 6
                Making 2 the root of the element 1.
