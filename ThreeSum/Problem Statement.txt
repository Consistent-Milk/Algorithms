Statement: Given N distinct integers, how many triples sum to exactly zero?

Algorithm Improvements:
The running time of ThreeSum algorithm can be reduced by replacing the third loop with the binary search
algorithm. This greatly reduces the number of array accesses necessary and makes the algorithm
O(N^2*LOG(N)) from O(N^3).
